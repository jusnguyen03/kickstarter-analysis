# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Challenge
This is an analysis of how successful plays were for kickstarter campaigns. The analysis will break down month to month successful and failed campaigns, and also each campaign's pledge fund goals compared to what was actually pledged. This analysis will help us determine when is the best time to have a play, and what our intended pledge amount goal we should aim for.

Please open and download the file titled "Module 1 Challenge.xlsx" to see the completed challenge assignment and analysis.
